        presently working as a real estate sales associate with Keller
        Williams. I currently hold a high school diploma and Associates
        of Science in Cybersecurity Degree and am seeking to build my
        skills as a web developer through the University of Central

        understand that every position requires a unique set of skills,
        and I am committed to continually developing my abilities to
        meet those needs. If I do not possess a particular quality
        necessary for the role, I am proactive in seeking out resources
        and training to acquire it.
